# ðŸ“Š Bank Loan Analysis (Python Project)
# Data analysis of bank loan records with Python to identify key insights on customer demographics, loan performance, and repayment behavior.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a bank loan dataset to identify key trends, customer behavior, and risk patterns.  
The analysis was performed using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** in a Jupyter Notebook.  

The goal of this project is to provide **data-driven insights** that can help financial institutions make better lending decisions and reduce default risks.

# Business Requirements / Objectives

   - The notebook answers several business-critical questions:
   - Loan Applications Over Time â€“ Monthly and yearly trends in applications.
   - Loan Funding Trends â€“ Total funded amount over time.
   - Loan Status Breakdown â€“ Fully Paid, Current, and Charged Off loans.
   - Loan Distribution by Categories â€“ Home Ownership, Purpose, and Term.
   - Customer Demographics â€“ Age group, region, and income analysis.
   - Loan Grade & Sub-Grade Analysis â€“ Funding and default risks.
   - Risk Analysis â€“ Identifying default-prone segments.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **interactive dashboards:** Plotly Express
- **Dataset Format:** Excel

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Imported dataset (CSV format)
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types  
   - Created new derived columns for better analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of loan amounts and funded amounts  
   - Customer segmentation by home ownership, employment length, and purpose of loan  
   - Loan performance across different income levels  

3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar plots, histograms, box plots, and pie charts for customer demographics  
   - Treemap for home ownership vs loan amount  
   - Trend analysis of loans funded over time  

4. **Insights & Findings**
   - Higher loan defaults observed in certain income brackets  
   - Customers with rented houses showed higher loan applications compared to owned homes  
   - Seasonal and yearly trends visible in loan funding amounts  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Customers with **lower annual income** had higher default rates.  
- Majority of loans were funded for **debt consolidation and credit card repayment**.  
- **Home ownership status** showed clear differences in loan approval trends.  
- A **steady increase** in loan funding amounts was observed year-over-year.  

---

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Apply **Machine Learning models** to predict loan defaults.  
- Build a **dashboard in Power BI / Tableau** for interactive visualization.  
- Perform **feature engineering** for better risk assessment.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the bankâ€™s loan portfolio by performing in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Key findings include:

- Identified trends in loan applications based on term, purpose, and state distribution.
- Highlighted approval and rejection patterns, helping to understand risk factors.
- Uncovered relationships between loan amount, interest rate, and borrower income.
- Provided data-driven insights to support decision-making for credit risk management.
 
 Overall, the analysis helps financial institutions minimize default risks, improve loan approval strategies, and enhance customer segmentation for better business outcomes.
